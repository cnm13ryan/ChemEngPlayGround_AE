* all of the form:
*   input + generation = output + consumption

* Assume 100% overall conversion so all toluene is consumed
balanceTu .. F2 * yTu  =e= xi3;

* benzene consumed in first reaction
balanceBz .. F2 * (1 - yTu) - xi1 =e= yPBz * PG;

* Ethylene fed and consumed in first, second and third reaction
balanceE .. F1 * yFE - xi1 - xi2 - 2*xi3 =e= yPE * PG;

* Propane generated in the third reaction
balanceP .. xi3 =e= (1 - yPE - yPBz) * PG;

* DEB produced in second reaction
balanceDEB .. xi2 =e= yDEB * BPD + (1-yEB) * PD ;

*EB consumed in second reaction, produced in first and third reaction
