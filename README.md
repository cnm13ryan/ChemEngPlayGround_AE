# Chemical Engineering Playground 
Compilation of Chemical Engineering Simulation and Process Synthesis toolkit

## Description
This project is centered around chemical engineering principles and focuses on simulation and process synthesis. It utilizes Pyomo, a Python-based, open-source optimization modeling language, along with other packages, to perform various chemical engineering tasks and analyses.

Check out this link for Pyomo examples for Chemical engineering  [Pyomo Examples] (https://github.com/Pyomo/pyomo/tree/main/examples/dae).

<!-- ```python -->
<!-- # Example: Importing and using Pyomo -->
<!-- from pyomo.environ import * -->

<!-- # Create a simple model -->
<!-- model = ConcreteModel() -->
<!-- model.x = Var([1,2], domain=NonNegativeReals) -->
<!-- model.OBJ = Objective(expr = 2*model.x[1] + 3*model.x[2]) -->
<!-- model.Constraint1 = Constraint(expr = 3*model.x[1] + 4*model.x[2] >= 1) -->
<!-- ``` -->
